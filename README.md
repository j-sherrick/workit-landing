## My process

The workit landing page was built with Sass following a BEM style architecture. It was bundled with Parcel and published to Github Pages following the [directions found here](https://gist.github.com/OleksiyRudenko/7e94aa2d18927e0c5e65b2b5a1c0e375)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- Responsive Grid
- Mobile-first
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS with superpowers
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)

### What I learned

I learned quite a bit about using CSS grid for responsive layouts. I worked on my Sass skills. I learned some things about SVG
